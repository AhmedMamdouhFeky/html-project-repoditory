    <h1><u>Definition</u></h1>
    <br>
    C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.

<h1><u>What makes learning it important?
</u></h1>
<br>
The C++ language is used to create computer programs and packaged software, such as games, office applications, graphics and video editors and operating systems.

<h1><u>Where did it start?
</u></h1>
Released in 1983 and often considered an object-oriented version of C language, C++ was created to compile lean, efficient code, while providing high-level abstractions to better manage large development projects.
